## What have I been doing all this time?

Currently, I'm an iOS developer at [adorsys](https://adorsys.de). I have been
doing that full time since 2016.<br>
I was with the company before that as a working student for about two years.

I studied Computer Science from 2012 to 2016 at
[TH NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/fakultaeten/in/).<br>My bachelor thesis
is about [Swift](https://github.com/xaverlohmueller/Bachelorarbeit).

From 2009 to 2012 I mostly spent my time failing at mechanical
engineering in [Erlangen](https://www.tf.fau.de).

Before all that, I spent my time mostly going to school in
[Schwabach](http://www.weg-schwabach.de/cms/index.php).<br>
Except for that one year I spent in [Woodbury, NJ](http://www.woodburysch.com).

<br>
Also, I used to work at [bar](https://www.facebook.com/Metrodrom.Schwabach) for
about 10 years. Nowadays, I host a pub quiz there.
