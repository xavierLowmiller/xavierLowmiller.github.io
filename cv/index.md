## What have I been doing all this time?

Currently, I'm an iOS developer at [adorsys][1]. I have been
doing that full time since 2016.<br>
I was with the company before that as a working student for about two years.

I studied Computer Science from 2012 to 2016 at [TH NÃ¼rnberg][2].<br>
My bachelor thesis is about [Swift][3].

From 2009 to 2012 I mostly spent my time failing at mechanical engineering 
in [Erlangen][4].

Before all that, I spent my time mostly going to school in [Schwabach][5].<br>
Except for that one year I spent in [Woodbury, NJ][6].

<br>
Also, I used to work at [bar][7] for
about 10 years. Nowadays, I host a pub quiz there.
