In here, I'll be listing some books (about programming) I like.

You can check back here, I'll probably add some.

<br>

- [Rework](https://37signals.com/rework)
  lets you cut the fat and focus on what's important.
- [Remote](https://37signals.com/remote)
  shows how you can be productive from anywhere you want.
- [Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)
  teaches how to fight the distractions around you to create something
  meaningful. Wish I had read this during my studies.
